Welcome everyone! This will be our central place to discuss and work on anything Alexa.  Since this is public facing so be sure not to commit anything with your credentials.  Happy coding!

## Alexa Skill Creation
To build an Alexa skill, you will need the following basics:
 > Sign up for an Amazon Developer account - "https://developer.amazon.com/"  
 > Sign up for an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account - "https://aws.amazon.com/"  

Navigate to "https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials" to get started. You will be able to create your own Alexa skill in no time!

## Quick Start

These steps are intended to allow new devs to quickly develop a basic app.

1. Log in the Base2 general AWS account.  There is a template app called "Base2" available at https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html#skills

2. Click on the Base2 app to be taken to the app screen.  

3. Click on "Interaction Model" to see the code driving the app.  Currently the Base2 app is capable of answering inquiries about the Base2 quality policy and objectives.  The inquiries it can handle are listed under "Sample Utterances."

4. The responses to the inquiries are defined by an AWS Lambda.  To see the Lambda, navigate to https://signin.aws.amazon.com and log in with the Base2 general AWS account.
